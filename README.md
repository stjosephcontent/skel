# skel
This skeleton repo was created as a basis for new SJC projects. Using it allows you to be future-compatibable with ops practices at SJC, even if you don't think you need them now. Skel is cognizant of Orchestra, SJC's docker wrapper, and Shelbot, SJC's robot devOps helper. Whenever possible, new repos should be created using *skel*.

# Folders
## git/**

This folder contains files you should place in the `.git` folder in your target repo.

`.git/crypt.sh` - This file includes crypt logic for `./listcrypt`, `./encrypt`, and `./decrypt`. It decides what files should be encrypted, and makes the corresponding helper files work.

`.git/hooks/pre-commit` - This makes use of `crypt.sh` and prevents you from commiting sensitive info if it's not encrypted.

`.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg` - will automatically parse out the Jira ticket number from an appropriately named branch, and add it to your commit message. This allows you to view all relevant commit messages in a given Jira ticket. The logic could be modified to look for assembla ticket numbers too.

## keys/{{person}}/*

People's public keys go here. This is to allow ops engineers a central repository for public keys. For deployment scripts to work, SSH+RSA authentication is needed.

## deploy/**

This folder contains all ansible data and logic called by `./a`, `./fleet`, and `./facts`. Use it to tweak and write deployment scripts using ansible.

### deploy/group_vars/{{group}}/*

This files are automatically loaded, depending on what group you have targed in `./a` (ex: `./a deploy stage` will load group_vars/stage/*.yml). The "all" directory is always loaded

### deploy/roles/*

Use [ansible best practices](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html) for organizing your deployment code into roles.

# Files
## a

*./a {script} {target}*

Runs a script found in the `deploy` folder and sets the target to a group defined in `deploy/inventories/aws`.

### Example commands

Run `deploy/deploy.yml` with *target* set to "prod": 
`$ ./a deploy prod`

Run `deploy/setup.yml` with *target* set to "stage": 
`$ ./a setup stage`

## fleet

*./fleet {target} {command}*

Runs ad-hoc commands against some or all of the hosts in `deploy/inventories/aws`.

### Example commands

Ask all servers in the "stage" group what operating system they are
`$ ./fleet stage uname -a`

Ask production servers what their hostnames are
`$ ./fleet prod hostname --fqdn`

Ask all servers what their nginx conf files look like
`$ ./fleet all 'cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*'`

Notice above that we used single quotes to avoid shell expansion happening on our machine, but allowing it to happen on the target machine.

## listcrypt

This command lists all files that are or should be encrypted, according to `.git/crypt.sh`. It must be run from the root of the repo.
`$ ./listcrypt`

## encrypt

This command encrypts any files that should be and are not encrypted, according to `.git/crypt.sh`.
`$ ./encrypt`

## decrypt

This command decrypts all encrypted files that `.git/crypt.sh` thinks should be encrypted.
`$ ./decrypt`

## ansible.cfg

This file allows dicts to be composed from several var files in ansible, avoiding unpleasant clobbering. I write deployment scripts assuming this is the case, so you should include it at the root of your repo if you want deployment scripts to be well behaved.

### deploy/inventories/aws

This file lists all your target hosts. Many apps will only have two groups: *stage* and *prod*, each with only one host. `./a`. You should always target a host group (instead of directly targetting a host), even if that group only consists of one host.

example of good:
`./a deploy stage # targetting a host group`

example of bad:
`./a deploy example-host-01 # targetting a host directly`


### deploy/private/.gitignore

This file is required to ensure that `vault_pass.txt` never gets commited to VCS. It is, however, acceptable to commit `vault_pass.txt.gpg` or `vault_pass.txt.asc`

### deploy/private/vault_pass.txt

Used by ansible-vault to encrpyt and decrypt sensitive info

### deploy/private/vault_pass.txt.gpg

If you are part of the ops group, you will be able to decrpyt this file. If you are creating the repo, you will be creating `vault_pass.txt` and this file.
